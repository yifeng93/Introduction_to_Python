### Class

When we start to learn `Class`, it is time to know what is [object-oriented-programming](<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/What-is-object-oriented-programming-OOP>). `Class` is a very important part in object-oriented-programming. In general, I may summarize `Class` is to simplify programming when we have big projects. It classifies objects with the same features. e.g. There are different types of students like primary school students, college students, etc. However, they do have something in common. e.g. they all have students numbers and courses grades.

I will use the following example to explain.

```python

# Here we define a class Dog, which is initiated with name and age. And the dog can sit and roll over.

Class Dog(): # Notice: the first letter for classed object should be capital.
    def _init_(self, name, age):
    """
    _init_ is default setting for name and age.
    There MUST be a self.
    """
       self.name = name
       self.age = age
    
    def sit(self):
       """
       define a sit function 
       """
       print(self.name.title() + "is now sitting."
       
    def roll_over(self):
       """
       define a roll_over function
       """
       print(self.name.title() + " rolled over!")
       
```
