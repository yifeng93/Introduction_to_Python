## Define and use lists

In Python, **a list is a data sequence composed of a series of elements in a specific order**, which means that you can save multiple data when you define a list. And it allows repetitive data. List is also a structured, non scalar type. We use `[]` to define a list, each element in list is separated with a comma.

```python

items_1 = [32, 42, 543, 12, 12]
items_2 = ['python', 'Go', 'Jave']

```


In addition, `list` is also a function in Python. If we define strictly, `list` is not a function. It is a constructor for creating list objects.

```python

items_1 = list(range(1,10))
print(items1)    # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
items2 = list('hello')
print(items2)    # ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']

```
