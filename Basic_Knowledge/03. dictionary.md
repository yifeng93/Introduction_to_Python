## Brief introduction to dictionary

We have introduced `list`. However, it seems sometimes `list` can not solve our problem. e.g. if we want to save some clients' information including name, age, address, etc. `List` is not a optimal choice then. Here we will use `dictionary`. We can compare the following example.

```shell

client1 = ['Lisa', '28', '228 Capital Ave']
client1 = {
           'name': 'Lisa'
           'age': 28
           'address': '228 Capital Ave'
           }

```
