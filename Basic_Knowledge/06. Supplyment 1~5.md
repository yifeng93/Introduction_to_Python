## the traversal and slice of string

If we want to select a specific character from string, the operator is `[n]`, `n` is a integer. Positive traversal range is from `0` to 'N-1'. Negative traversal range is from `-1` to `-N`. 

```python

a = 'ABCD12345'
N = len(a)
print(len(a))

# two methods to get the first character：
print(a[0])  # A
print(a[-N]) # A

# two methods to get the last character：
print(a[N-1])  # 5
print(a[-1])   # 5

```

If we need to select multiple characters from string, then we need to **slice** string. The operator of slice is `[a:b:c]`, `a` is traversal starting, it is **included**. `b` is traversal ending, it is **NOT included**. `c` is step, default value is `1`. `c > 0` means positive slice, the default values for `a` and `b` are `0` and `N` if they are not given. `c < 0` means negative slice, the default values for `a` and `b` are `-1` and `-N-1` if they are not given.
