**In this part, I will add some supplyment materials for part 1~5. Because it is super hard to study Python strictly following step-by-step. There is always mixed knowledge will be used. 

## the traversal and slice of string

If we want to select a specific character in a string, the operator is `[n]`, `n` is a integer. Positive traversal range is from `0` to 'N-1'. Negative traversal range is from `-1` to `-N`. 

```python

a = 'ABCD12345'
N = len(a)
print(len(a))

# two methods to get the first character：
print(a[0])  # A
print(a[-N]) # A

# two methods to get the last character：
print(a[N-1])  # 5
print(a[-1])   # 5

```
