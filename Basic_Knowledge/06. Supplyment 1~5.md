>*In this part, I will add some supplyment materials for part 1~5. Because it is super hard to study Python strictly following step-by-step. There is always mixed knowledge will be used.*


## the traversal and slice of string

If we want to select a specific character from string, the operator is `[n]`, `n` is a integer. Positive traversal range is from `0` to 'N-1'. Negative traversal range is from `-1` to `-N`. 

```python

a = 'ABCD12345'
N = len(a)
print(len(a))

# two methods to get the first character：
print(a[0])  # A
print(a[-N]) # A

# two methods to get the last character：
print(a[N-1])  # 5
print(a[-1])   # 5

```

If we need to select multiple characters from string, then we need to **slice** string. The operator of slice is `[a:b:c]`, `a` is traversal starting, it is **included**. `b` is traversal ending, it is **NOT included**. `c` is step, default value is `1`. `c > 0` means positive slice, the default values for `a` and `b` are `0` and `N` if they are not given. `c < 0` means negative slice, the default values for `a` and `b` are `-1` and `-N-1` if they are not given. 


```python

# there are 9 characters in this string
X = 'ABCD12345'

# a=3, b=5, c=1，positive starting from the 4th character(3 is included) to the 5th character(5 is NOT included. Step lenth is 1.
print(X[3:5])    # D1

# a=-3, b=-6, c=1
print(X[-6:-3])  # D12

# a=-3, b=9, k=2
print(X[-3::2])  #35 We can see that 'b' is N when it is not given and c >0.

# a=-3, b=9, k=-1
print(X[-3::-1])  #321DCBA 

```


## Python operators
I am not good at describing defination in English. For Python operators, please read this [page](<https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/python_basic_operators.htm>). It is more clear.

| operator                                                     | description                   |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------|
| `[:]`                                                        | slice                     |
| `**`                                                         | exponent                      |
| `+` `-`                                                       | positive; negative          |
| `*` `/` `%` `//`                            | multiplication；division;modulus;floor division |
| `+` `-`                                                      | addition;subtraction          |
| `>>` `<<`                                                 | Right and left bitwise shift       |
| `&`                                                          | Bitwise AND                      |
| `^` `\|`                                           | Bitwise exclusive `OR' and regular `OR'  |
| `<=` `<` `>` `>=`                                            | comparison operators         |
| `==` `!=`                                                    | equal; NOT equal              |
| `is`  `is not`                                               | logical operators             |
| `in` `not in`                                                | logical operators              |
| `not` `or` `and`                                             | logical operators             |

>**Notice：** For the priority of operators, mostly it follows basic mathmatic rule. But if you do not sure the specific priority of operators, always try '()' to solve it.


## Python placeholders

Obviously placeholders means taking a position for later usage. The followings are some common placeholers.


| placeholers                                                 | description                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------ |
| %d                                                           | placeholder for `int`   |
| %s                                                           |placeholder for `str`   |
| %f                                                           |placeholder for `float`  |
| %.nf                                          | `n` represents how many decimals reserved     | 


#### some applications of placeholders
```python

# transit attribute of dictionary
print("Hi!%(name)s. "%{'name':';'Linda'})
output: Hi！Linda.

# to set width
print("My height is %4f meter." %(1.81))
print("My height is %12f meter." %(1.81))
output:
My height is 1.810000 meter.
My height is     1.810000 meter. # I just simply do NOT understand this one. Why spaces?

# to set precision
print("My height is %.1f meter." %(1.81))
output: My height is 1.8 meter.
```

>**Question:** What if we want to set multiple attributes simultaneously. e.g. width and precision together. How should we do ?


#### A typical application of operators and placeholders (from internet)


```Python

"""
input() to input string.
int() to transfer string to integer

Version: 0.1
Author: 骆昊
"""
a = int(input('a = '))
b = int(input('b = '))
print('%d + %d = %d' % (a, b, a + b))
print('%d - %d = %d' % (a, b, a - b))
print('%d * %d = %d' % (a, b, a * b))
print('%d / %d = %f' % (a, b, a / b))
print('%d // %d = %d' % (a, b, a // b))
print('%d %% %d = %d' % (a, b, a % b))
print('%d ** %d = %d' % (a, b, a ** b))
```
>**Notice:** `%%` means percent here since `%` means place holder here.
