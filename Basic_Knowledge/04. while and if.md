## Basic function code

### for-in loop

If you know exact loop times, `for-in` is recommended. e.g. if we want to calculate the sum of 1 to 100.

```python

# sum of 1~100

sum = 0
for x in range(1,101):
    sum += x
print(sum)

```

Another example is that if we roll a die for 10000 times and then count the quantity of every point. we do as follow.

```python
import random

counters = [0] * 6
# then we will get a list: counters = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], each element represents the quantity of each point in the end.
for _ in range(10000):
    face = random.randint(1, 6)
    # Notice: in this range, 6 is included. Different from slice.
    counters[face - 1] += 1
    # Notice: [face - 1] is to take traversal principal into consideration.
for face in range(1, 7):
    # range() needs to consider traversal principal. 7 is not included.
    print(f'{face} exists {counters[face - 1]}times')
    
```


### while loop

If we do not know the exact loop times, `while` is recommended. A `bool` value will be construced to control the loop when we use `while` loop. If `Ture`, then the loop continues. If `False`, then stops. Let's use a 'guessing game' (1-100) to explain.

```python

import random

answer = random.randint(1,100)
counter = 0
while True:
    counter += 1
    number = int(input('enter your number: '))
    if number < answer:
        print("guess a bigger one")
    elif number > answer:
        print("guess a smaller one")
    else:
        print("congratuations, you are right")
        break
print('you have guessed %d times' %counter)
if counter > 5:
    print("please top up your IQ")
    
```
