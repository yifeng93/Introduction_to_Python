## Basic function code

### for-in loop

If you know exact loop times, `for-in` is recommended. e.g. if we want to calculate the sum of 1 to 100.

```python

# sum of 1~100

sum = 0
for x in range(1,101):
    sum += x
print(sum)

```

Another example is that if we roll a die for 10000 times and then count the quantity of every point. we do as follow.

```python
import random

counters = [0] * 6
# then we will get a list: counters = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], each element represents the quantity of each point in the end.
for _ in range(10000):
    face = random.randint(1, 6)
    # Notice: in this range, 6 is included. Different from slice.
    counters[face - 1] += 1
    # Notice: [face - 1] is to take traversal principal into consideration.
for face in range(1, 7):
    # range() needs to consider traversal principal. 7 is not included.
    print(f'{face} exists {counters[face - 1]}times')
    
```
