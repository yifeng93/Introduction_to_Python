## My Zen of Python study

First, all programming language study is a process of **learning by doing**. If you want your **learning curve** as sharp as possible, then try to do different level of projects. 

Then, rookie always make mistakes, which is "I thought I know". It is common that you seem understand every line of code on textbook. However, your brain just 'blackout' when you close the book.

In the end, enjoy the process of **debug**. Sometimes it is very beneficial to spend a lof of time to debug.
