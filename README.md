## My Zen of Python study

First, all programming language study is a process of **learning by doing**. If you want your **learning curve** as sharp as possible, then try to do different level of projects. 

Then, rookie always make mistakes, which is "I thought I know". It is common that you seem understand every line of code on textbook. However, your brain just 'blackout' when you close the book.

In the end, enjoy the process of **debug**. Sometimes it is very beneficial to spend a lof of time to debug.


## How to study with me?

1. Install Python and read some basic knowledge in this [page:'Python programming for the absolute beginner'](<https://pythonguides.com/python-programming-for-the-absolute-beginner/>). Because in this repository I will not explain how to install and configurate environment. There are tons of tutorials and videos on internet. *<My environment: Win10 professional 64-bit system; x64-based processor; Python 3.87; Pycharm Community 2020.3.2>*

2. Study following the Table of Content. I will summarize or write a supplyment material when a study session is finished. So, if you do not understand some part of material, you may find explaination in the summary or supplyment. E.g. There is a [06. Supplyment 1~5.md](<https://github.com/yifeng93/Introduction_to_Python/blob/main/Basic_Knowledge/06.%20Supplyment%201~5.md>) in the [Basic_Knowledge folder](<https://github.com/yifeng93/Introduction_to_Python/tree/main/Basic_Knowledge>) to explain some knowledge unclear in part_01 to part_05.

3. Related exercises will be in a separe folder. Do exercises regularly.

4. There are always mistakes in this repository. Do NOT hesitate to commit changes and corret them. I will be appreciate it a lot.
